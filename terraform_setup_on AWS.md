# 📄 Setting Up Terraform with AWS: A Beginner's Guide

---

## 🔰 Introduction to Terraform and AWS

**Terraform** is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp, using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).  
**AWS** (Amazon Web Services) is Amazon's cloud platform offering IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

## ✅ Why Use Terraform with AWS?

- 🚀 **Automation & Efficiency** – Automates provisioning, reduces human error  
- 📈 **Scalability** – Easily scale resources up/down  
- 📚 **Version Control** – Enables rollback and change history through code

## 🔐 Configuring AWS Provider Credentials

### 1️⃣ Create IAM User
- Go to AWS Console → IAM
- Create a user with **Programmatic Access**
- Save **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**

### 2️⃣ Configure AWS Credentials in Terraform

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
  access_key = "your_access_key_here"
  secret_key = "your_secret_key_here"
}
````

> 💡 **Tip**: It's more secure to use environment variables instead of hardcoding secrets.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## 📁 Basic Structure of a Terraform Project

### `main.tf`

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

### `variables.tf`

```hcl
variable "region" {
  description = "The AWS region"
  default     = "us-east-1"
}
```

### `outputs.tf`

```hcl
output "bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id
}
```

## 📦 Backend Configuration: Remote State Storage

Use remote backends like **Amazon S3** to:

* 🔄 Share state across teams
* 🔐 Enable state locking
* 📜 Maintain state history

### Example: S3 Backend Block

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "state"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

## 🔒 Managing Sensitive Data with AWS Secrets Manager

Avoid hardcoding secrets like passwords or API keys. Use **Secrets Manager**.

```hcl
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "my_secret" {
  secret_id = "my_secret_name"
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "my_database" {
  # ...
  password = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.my_secret.secret_string
}
```

## 🏁 Conclusion

Using **Terraform + AWS** lets you:

* ✅ Automate infrastructure setup
* ✅ Secure sensitive credentials
* ✅ Collaborate using remote state

### 🔍 You Now Know:

* How to configure AWS provider
* How to structure Terraform projects
* How to use S3 for remote state

## 🧠 Architecture Diagram

Visualize the process:

1. Developer writes `.tf` code
2. Terraform CLI authenticates with AWS
3. Resources like EC2, S3, DB are created
4. Terraform state is stored in S3
5. Secrets are pulled from Secrets Manager
